# Bioinformatics clinic 1st April 2019

### Kristy Horan

I will be talking on two rather distinct tools that I use regularly to wrangle data and to visualise phylogenies, the python dataframe package `pandas` and the R tree visualisation library `ggtree`. 

Both will be introductory, but assume that everyone has a basic knowledge of R and/or Python. If you would like to play along having R studio and Jupyter installed would be helpful.

**R Studio**

[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

**Jupyter**

If you would like to read the instructions....
[https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

OR in terminal window

`pip3 install jupyter`

## Introduction to pandas.

### What is a dataframe?

Simply put a tabular representation of data, in our work rows are often samples (isolates or experimental conditions) and columns are some characteristic of those samples. This format often makes it easy for us to understand how the data is organised and allows for fairly straighforward visualisations (topic for another day perhaps). 

### Why Pandas??

R also has dataframes... in fact I would almost go so far as to say that R depends on dataframes. So why choose Pandas?

Well Python is my go to language, whilst R has many 'shiny' bits and pieces, I find Python more flexible. So I will offer an alternative to the R dataframe. Apart from my fondness for Python, I find that one of the major advantages is that it is a single module/package and largely follows Python syntaxt - so it is pretty easy to learn. It also plays well with `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` and many other Python visualisation packages to provide a rich suite of tools for statistical and visualisation purposes (again another topic for another day).

### Get Started

Installing `pandas` is very easy.

`pip3 install pandas`!!

I will be demonstrating using a jupyter notebook so if you want to play along then see above for isntall directions.
